# Twitter Cookie Scrapper

Automate obtaining Twitter cookie for authentication, using Puppeteer.

## Introduction

This Node.js script allows you to easily scrape Twitter cookie.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your system.
- A Twitter account with your username and password.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dante4rt/Twitter-Cookie-Scrapper.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Twitter-Cookie-Scrapper
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your Twitter username and password. The script will then navigate to the Twitter login page, enter your credentials, and save the cookies to a file named `twitter_cookies.json`.

## Important Notes

- Keep your `twitter_cookies.json` file secure, as it contains your Twitter authentication data.
